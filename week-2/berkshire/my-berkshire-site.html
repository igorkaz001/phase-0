<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
The struggle for me was to implement all individual aspects of html such as links and images into the website as a whole. I got practice combining tags on the same line of code.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Unfortunately I didnt do much semantic html5 elements in this challenge. Or I do so unknowingly.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I tried to create open and close tags for things such as "head" and "html" right away, then add text between those tags. Also, I tried to keep indentation consistent with best practice for readability. 
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good: it is fairly simple at this point, just have to remember to close the tags that I opened. The bad: some of the syntax isn't easy to remember since it isnt close to plain english. 
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I had a cheat sheet handy for remember syntax. I also tried to visualize the skeleton of a website format to help me remeber some of the aspects of setting up the html page.
