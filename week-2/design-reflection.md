My site's primary goal is to attrack employers. The site will feature my blog, my past projects, about me section, ways to contact me or the social media links.

My target audience's interests are quilified developers. I hope to demonstrate my competnecy by showing them my past projects, and my analytical skills by showing them my blog. 

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary actions will be the user choosing what they want view about me, after seeing the first introductory page. I want them to then go to my blog or projects page to see if my experience is something they are looking for. Then if they are satisfied, they should go to the contact me page. 

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
UX is focused around the questions of how the user feels when interacting with something. It is a way to design something not for efficiency, or cost but for the product to be user friendly and user accessable (in reference to screen readers and other accesibility tools).

UX design has introduced the idea that decisions made during design stage should not be based solely on what the client wants, but how will it make the user feel when using the said product. 

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
For me reading about UX design was the most tedicous because the article kept giving information on different aspects and definitions of UX design, and it was a bit challenging to sort through all that info. Also it was taking me away from actualy doing something on command prompt or sublime.
