What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a rough mockup of the design aspect of a site. Almost like a sketch, be it digital or analog. 

What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing allows for designers to conecptualize the design before actually commiting efforts and resources into going ahead with it. It may also be shown to a client for approval to make sure the designer is on track. 

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
It was fun to learn about wireframing, but I did not get much pleasure out of wireframing because I am not good at the concept of design in general.  

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I stuck with the first design, because I did not want to get stuck in a time-wasting sinkhole by tweaking the wireframe. 

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I did some outside research into good wireframing tools. There are many out there, but I only looked at the simple ones and ones that were offering a free trial, since I do not need to buy this kind of tool just yet. 

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed learning about the concepts of wireframing, its definition, its use in a professional environment. I found the process of finding a useable tool for the wireframe to be a bit tedious. I did not want to resort to using a pen/paper approach because I would not learn about the wireframing software that way, which may come handy one day.
