##1.6 My Website

-Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
https://github.com/igorkaz001/igorkaz001.github.io

-Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
First find a plus sign at the top right of github page, then click add new repository. Input repo name, short description, mark it public, check to make sure it adds a README file, select MIT status, and click green button to create the repo. Find the https clone url on the right side of the page and copy it. In terminal input a command 'git clone <copied url>'.

-Describe what open source means.
Open source means we are not only getting a version of a program that the computer outputs, but the source code or the inner workins of a program as well. This allows us to tweak the application as we please, as opposed to not having access or legal right to change anything inside the program. 

-What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
To me open source means developers will focus less on protecting thier inventions and making as much money as possible, and instead focus on taking other people's code further, thus moving technology further without hampering effects of greed. 

-Assess the importance of using licenses.
Having the right kind of open source license will assure that code we write will stay out there for everyone to see, use, and improve upon. Wrong type license will prevent people from having free access to the code. No license at all will open up a possibility of somone else gettin a license for it and thus claim ownership to something they didnt write. 

-What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This challege helped me solidify the git commands used for branching out, add/commit/pushing, merging branches, and pulling. There wasn't any challanging parts to this challenge, although I did have to remove the first repo I made because it was in the wrong place. 

-Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I did not find any resources of my own for this challenge.
