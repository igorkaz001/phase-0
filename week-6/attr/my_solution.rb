Release 1:
What are these methods doing?
These methods are setter methods, some are reader methods. They are storing values in the initialized variables then displaying it. Some methods are modifying the data.

How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?
They are modifying the data by taking an argument in the setter method to change the value after the inital value has been set at the top. These arguments are given at the bottom when the methods are called.
