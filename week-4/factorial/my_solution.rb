# Factorial

# I worked on this challenge by myself

# psuedocode
# -input: integer
# -output: factorial of that interger
# -establish a loop to keep subracting one and only work when number is bigger than 0
# -have the number multiplied by the next iteration of it or the one less by one. 
# -have a conditional for factorial 0 to be 1
# -return the result

# Your Solution Below
def factorial(number)
  	 if (number >= 2)
  		result.each do |number| number * (number -1)
  		number -=
  	end

  	return result
  	else
  		number == 0 || number == 1
  		return 1
  	end
		

end
#This is as close as i got to getting factorial to work without using refactoring, per instructions.
#Couldnt really get this to work.
