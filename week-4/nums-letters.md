What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a round number, while a float number has a decimal. 

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will take the output and simply round it down, or simply ditch everything after the decimal point. Float division will retain everything after the decimal point. Interger division is used more in real world as opposed to academia research or 3d design. For example if I wanted to devide 10 ice cream bars between 3 kids: 10/3=3.33333, yet I cant give someone 3.33333 of a an ice cream bar, so they will get 3. You cant divide the number of chairs, pens, cars, etc without breaking them. So intenger division is used for things such as pens, chairs, cars, airplanes etc, that can not be divided up without breaking them.
