##Release 1: summarize
What does puts do?
Stands for put string, meaning display output in concole in form of a string. 

What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a round number, while a float number has a decimal. 

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will take the output and simply round it down, or simply ditch everything after the decimal point. Float division will retain everything after the decimal point. Interger division is used more in real world as opposed to academia research or 3d design. For example if I wanted to devide 10 ice cream bars between 3 kids: 10/3=3.33333, yet I cant give someone 3.33333 of a an ice cream bar, so they will get 3. You cant divide the number of chairs, pens, cars, etc without breaking them. So intenger division is used for things such as pens, chairs, cars, airplanes etc, that can not be divided up without breaking them.

##Release 7: Reflect 

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
It handles it just like a calculator using the same symbols. Nothing noteworthy there. 

What is the difference between integers and floats?
An integer is a round whole number, while a float has a decimal point. 

What is the difference between integer and float division?
Integer division will round the answer down to the nearest whole number, while float division will give a more accurate answer with the decimal point. 

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are collection of characters tied together. You can use them to represent characters, letters, sentences, and numbers. you would use them to assign a value to a variable. 

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables start with a lowercase and are used within a single method or within a single class. I believe you would use them when defining new variable for the program since local variables are more commonly used that global variables. 

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
Yes, it allowed me to jump back into ruby and remind me of the basics. It was fairly painless.
