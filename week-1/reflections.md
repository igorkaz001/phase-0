## 1.1 Think about time reflection
Some of the new time management and productivity ideas I learned about was finding flow or getting into the zone when doing tasks, timeboxing techniques such as pomodoro method, the hammer method, and mediation. 
Timeboxing is a productivity strategy that allocates a certain amount of time for the task at hand. The work on the task is stopped when the time runs out even if the task isn’t done. Then the work is evaluated and the timebox can be evaluated for effectiveness.
Currently I do not use any official time management techniques, instead I use strategies such as making lists of tasks to be done. I also allocate a certain amount of time to each task, but only stop when the task is done, as opposed to timeboxing.
The current strategy was working for me so far, but i believe it can be made more efficient with by integrating some of the new strategies I learned. I plan to employ meditation techniques to increase focus and help me get into the the “zone”, and a version of a timbering method such as pomodoro.
The overall plan for phase 0 time management is to learn more about timeboxing,  mediation and the “hammer” method of breaking up a big task into smaller, doable ones. Then taking those skill and implementing them as much as possible into my work/study process.

## 1.2 The command line reflection

1. Shell is a bash interpreter. That is shell is a scripting language, which bash is then able to run inside the terminal window. I have also found that the terminal on osx is actually an emulator of an old-school style terminals used to connect to unix machines. 

2. The most challenging part of going through this material is being exposed to many different commands and functions that I am able to run in shell. I understand the basic ones and some of the more complex ones, but I am not sure I was able to remember all of them, since many are not used on a daily basis. 

3. I had trouble using the "vim" application since I am not too familiar with its operation. Other than that I had some confusion using the pipes and redirection of commands in the terminal.

4. I believe the most important commands are the to create/remove files and directories, finding  strings or files within directories, commands for moving around directories, and the help and manual support inside terminal to explain unfamiliar commands. 

5. pwd = displays current location inside the directories

ls = lists all files within the current directory

mv = move command

cd = change directory

../ = not sure what this is. i believe ./ is used for running an executable file

touch = creates a new file inside current directory

mkdir = makes a new directory 

less = used to preview a file. it is a smaller version of preview as opposed to the 'more' command

rmdir = remove directory

rm = remove a file

help = provides information on available commands and functions

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning
To create a new repo, use git init while in the directory of the project. forking a repo can be done on github site by clicking the fork button and saving that repo to your own github profile. to clone a repo, copy and paste url on github repo page, then use commands 'git clone [copied url]'. I believe these tasks can be done on github website using the interface instead of commands. Forking a repo as opposed to creating a new one, lets you get a sample project and start working on it right away. Creating a new repository will just be an empty repo that you will need to populate with content. 

I did not have much struggle setting up git, since instructions were quite clear and the process was not too complex. The only thing that gave me some trouble was setting up ssh key on github, which is not needed at this point and can be avoided by using the https link. In this exersize I learned how to use git on command line as well as what "../" does. It opens up all projects/files in the current directory as well as the one above the one I am in.
