<!-- What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
It is important to memorize the "link" line that goes into the head element. Also it is important to create the right path for the CSS file.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
We didnt use many tricks, but we did use a table to position the list and split it into two columns. 

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used a few classes to modify a block of code all at once, and some individual elements such as p, a, span tags.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We did add a few classes. One was used to modify the entier header. It is adviseable not to use id's and use classes as much as possible, thats why we went with that. 


When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why? 
I believe they had cleaner code because it was looked more organized. Yet, I belive that we had used best practices because our css was on a separate file as opposed to them using css modifications right on the html file, making it more complex.
