            <h3>Version Control</h3>
                <p>Version control system is a repository of files that keeps revisions of the modifications and changes. When developers writes codes, they often make a lot of changes to the code so there will be many versions. So programmers/developers can download these versions as they need or upload the latest codes. By this, every programmer can contribute to the project, it also helps them to collaborate easily. If you ever need to go back to the old version of any project, you can easily roll back to an earlier project.</p>
            <h3>Git</h3>
                <p>Git is an open-source fast version control that is used to store information. Whenever there is a change within the file, Git saves the state of your information by taking snapshots of all files status at that moment and provides a history of content changes. Git ensures the integrity of the content and stores the snapshots of file changes. Each time you make a change, Git takes the snapshot of the change within the file, and store it with a reference number. You can easily go back to the previous stage with this reference number. In GitHub, all of the changes can be found with a command of "git log".</p>
