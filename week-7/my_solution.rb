# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [ with: David Ma ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# Allows for access to methods in another file stored locally, or remote data
# Difference between relative and just require is that relative looks in the folder where the file is, and require looks for an absolute path

# {"Alabama" => {pop_den: 92, pop: 100} }
# {pop_den: 92, pop: 100}

# "key" => value
# key: value

# So if the key is a string or an integer, you must use hash rocket syntax

# "string": value # This will not work.

# key: value is just a shortcut for the hashrocket version...
# :key => value


# my_array[index] => element
# my_hash[key] => value

# {key: value}
# my_hash[key:] # This does not work!

# Even if you use colon syntax, remember that its a shortcut for a regular ol symbol.

# my_hash[:key]



# STATE_DATA
# A variable in all caps is a CONSTANT
# A constant variable has global scope.
# Its basically the same thing as a global variable.
# HOWEVER, you are not supposed to re-define a constant.

# STATE_DATA = "Test" solution.rb:98: warning: already initialized constant STATE_DATA 
#solution.rb:43: warning: previous definition of STATE_DATA was here

# Rather than recreating all 50 of these 1 by 1... 
# Is there a way we can automate this process (read use a loop)


# How to use a template in a loop.

# 1. Take an existing piece of driver code...
#  - Figure out what parts change for each state?

# 2. Turn that driver code into a template, by replacing the changing parts with variables.

# 3. Use that template in a loop, passing the (current state) variable in each time.
